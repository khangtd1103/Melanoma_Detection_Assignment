## General Information
- Develops a custom CNN model to automate the detection of melanoma from dermatological images, aiming to improve early diagnosis and treatment outcomes.
- Aiming to enhance melanoma detection, this project leverages a CNN model to aid dermatologists in early cancer diagnosis.
- The project addresses the need for more accurate and efficient melanoma screening to improve patient outcomes.
- Utilizing 2357 images from ISIC, the dataset encompasses various skin conditions, with a focus on melanoma and moles for model training.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- The classes distribution images are highly imbalanced.
- The model quickly became overfit due to the limited number of samples from each class.
- Convolutional neural networks perform well at first, but then plateau at a peak accuracy of 60%.
- Data augmentation has a limited and inconsistent impact.
